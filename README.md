Hi, I'm Marcello Novak.

I'm currently a college freshman at ERAU prescott, majoring in Computer Engineering Robotics.

Currently I'm working with a research team with my school under a research grant to predict thunderstorms! [Read more here](https://news.erau.edu/headlines/embry-riddle-researchers-use-machine-learning-to-tackle-monsoon-season)

&emsp; - Intermediate stuff using Python, JavaScript, SQL, and C++\
&emsp; - Discord Bots and other APIs\
&emsp; - Linux/VMs and running a Minecraft server on a dedicated machine using Ubuntu\
&emsp; - GNS3/Wireshark/Putty once in a while, I took Cisco CCNA/CCNP in high school
