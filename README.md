Hi, I'm Marcello Novak.

I'm currently a high school senior, and I plan to major in either computer science or computer engineering.

Here's a brief list of the things I like to tinker with:\
&emsp; - Arduino Microelectronics and creating my own projects from scratch\
&emsp; - Designing, wiring, and soldering PCBs for my Arduino projects\
&emsp; - Designing parts for/using my 3D printer\
&emsp; - Intermediate stuff using Python, JavaScript, SQL, and C++\
&emsp; - Discord Bots and other APIs\
&emsp; - Linux/VMs and running a Minecraft server on a dedicated machine using Ubuntu\
&emsp; - GNS3 once in a while, I took Cisco CCNA/CCNP in high school\
&emsp; - Fixing physical day to day problems with Macgyver-esque solutions

Feel free to sift through the snippets of code I've posted on here!
