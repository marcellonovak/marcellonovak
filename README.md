Hi, I'm Marcello Novak.

I'm currently a college freshman at ERAU prescott, majoring in Computer Engineering Robotics.

Currently I'm working with a research team with my school under a research grant to predict thunderstorms! [Read More](https://news.erau.edu/headlines/embry-riddle-researchers-use-machine-learning-to-tackle-monsoon-season)

Some of the things I'm currently interested in:
&emsp; - Advanced data structures and optimization in Python
&esmp; - Learning ReactJS to use as a framework for [My Portfolio](https://marcellonovak.com)
&emsp; - Linux/VMs, creating domain controllers and a NAS, to freshen my CCNP skills

Feel free to sift through the snippets of code I've posted on here!
